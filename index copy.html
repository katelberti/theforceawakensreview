<h2>The Cast</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hans Solo</li>
<li>Princess General</li>
<li>Luke (sort of)</li>
<li>Rey</li>
<li>Fin</li>
<li>Han Solo's creepy son (whose name I don't care about)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reasons Why I Didn't Take You to the Movie</h2>
<ol>
  <li>You would probably talk through the entire movie</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Because you think you're smarter than George Lucas...and you're not</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Because Mom said you're adopted</li>
  <li>You aren't real</li>
</ol>
<h2>Some Older Sibling Wisdom</h2>
<p>Hello little brother. Remember that time Dad brought me to see The Force Awakens wihout you? I do. Best 212 minutes of my life. Anyway, I feel KIND of bad - can't you tell? - so I figured I would give you a little overview of what I thought about the film.</p>
<p>While I promised myself that I would never become a Satr Wars fan, over Winter Break I watched all six originals and then went to see the newest in theaters. After seeing Episode 4 I was not impressed at all and almost gave up on the series.  Episodes 4, 5, and 6 were not my favorite, but I understand why they were necessary.</p>
<p>Episodes 1, 2, and 3 are a completely differnt ballgame.  Not only did the graphics improve ten-fold, but it made the entire series make more sense by seeing the last three episodes first.  Part of me thought that the reasons filmmakers decided to make the last three first was because the first three required more advanced visual effects.  While I still believe this is partially true - because 1, 2, and 3 are superior in graphics - the plot makes more sense in the way it was done: 4, 5, 6 then 1, 2, 3.</p>
<p>Seeing 7 - The Force Awakens - in theaters was a very conflicting experience for me.  While it was a great movie independently, I was very confused at how it fit into the pervious series.  The fact that it was set decades later was not well communicated.  It wasn't until Han Solo was introduced - and aged 40+ years - did I understand what was happening time-wise.</p>
